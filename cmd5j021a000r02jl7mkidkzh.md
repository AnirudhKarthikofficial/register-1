Still worried about a low GPA?

Didn’t graduate from a top-tier university?

Don’t have a formal CS degree?

Here’s the truth:

Employers don’t just want to see your grades — they want to see your skills.

And there’s no better place to showcase that than your GitHub.

Here’s why GitHub matters more than your academic record:

✅ It shows what you’ve actually built

Not what you memorized for an exam or contributed to in a group project. It’s your real work — your logic, your decisions, your code.

✅ It proves consistency

Your commit history tells a story. Are you learning? Building regularly? Improving? Your GitHub becomes a timeline of your growth.

✅ It verifies your skills

No vague resume lines. No guesswork. Hiring managers can look at your code and understand exactly how you think.

✅ It sets you apart

Thousands of grads share similar degrees. But your GitHub? That’s 100% unique to you.

GPA is a number.

GitHub is evidence.

A recruiter isn’t thinking:

“Wow, a 3.8 GPA.”

They’re thinking:

“Oh, you built and deployed a full stack app? Let’s talk.”

So stop waiting for permission.

Start coding.

Finish those side projects.

Write solid READMEs.

Document your process.

You don’t need a perfect GPA to belong — you just need to build like you do.
